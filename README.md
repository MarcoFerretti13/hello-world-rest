# Hello World REST Service

Simple REST Service that echos the requests. 
This service runs inside a container. 

Run with

```
docker run -ti --rm -p 5050:5050 vad1mo/hello-world-service
```

Be patient, because it takes some time until all dependencies are downloaded and the container actually repsonses to requests.
